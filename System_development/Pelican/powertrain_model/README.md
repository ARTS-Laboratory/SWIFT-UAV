Here, we have a model of the v1 version of the SWIFT UAV. It includes the powertrain model i.e.
+ The control system - Closed loop control system with a motion sensor at the Rotor
+ Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)
+ BLDC Motor (X7215 Brushless DC Motor)
+ Propeller - This also includes a few other mechanical components and sensors like the mass and the damper used to represent flight profiles or paths

The model needs to be run with the .mat folder as it contains the input parameters used.
